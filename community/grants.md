## 🎯 Evaluation criteria

<details>
  <summary>Click for details</summary>
  <div>
    <p>We love and encourage diversity of ideas in grant applications. This section lists the baseline expectations we have for all applications.</p>
    <p>XMTP grants are <strong>not</strong> for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integrating with XMTP</strong>: Merely integrating with XMTP does not quality for a grant.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing budgets</strong>: Grant money should not be used towards promoting or advertising projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Replacements for venture funding:</strong> Grants are not substitutions for a round of funding. They are aimed at enabling discrete projects that create a public good for the ecosystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Free money</strong>: Please don’t abuse this system. Our program’s mission is to support people who believe in the potential of web3 messaging and want to contribute to building in the space.</li>
      <li><strong>Stress relief</strong>: Our grants are not intended to extend your runway or alleviate financial stress. You should aim to build long-term in our ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider the following criteria if you’re uncertain whether your project qualifies for an XMTP grant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Building in public</strong>: Not all projects require code, but they should be built in the spirit of open-sourcing your learnings (and code if appropriate) for everyone to learn from.</li>
      <li><strong>Action > Perfection</strong>: Show us how you or your team have the skills and potential to bring the proposal to life.</li>
      <li><strong>Definitive use case</strong>: Articulate your idea clearly on how your project uses XMTP and adds value to the ecosystem. Please do not try to overthink or overcomplicate it.</li>
      <li><strong>Public good creation</strong>: Show clear connection between your proposal and the value it generates for the broader ecosystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaborate</strong>: Be collaborative and open to offering support to other members of our community. Let’s grow together!</li>
    </ul>
