# Built with XMTP

- Displays projects using XMTP
- Will also highlight and showcase "project of the month" using XMTP
  - "Project of the Month" might be a post on xmtp.org/blog and this page can link to the month's post
- Created this as an MDX file - more info on how to use MDX and React in Docusaurus: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react
- Rich: What do you think of the sidebar/left nav order? We can change it to suit your vision!
- Rich: What do you think of the top nav menu - sparkle icon and the "Explore a showcase of apps built with XMTP" text? We can change that too...
