# XMTP Website Starter Kit

This web starter is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Local Development

```
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment
