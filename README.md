To work on a documentation issue, you must submit a pull request (PR) to the `xmtp-dot-org` repo.

A PR is a request to the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team to add (or pull) your content updates into the project and publish them to the documentation on the site. After you submit a pull request, your proposed changes are publicly visible, meaning that anyone with a GitHub account can see them on GitHub.

    * Accept your proposal and publish your change
    * Accept your proposal but ask for some changes before publishing
    * Not accept your proposal and explain why

Here are two common techniques for submitting a PR to the `xmtp-dot-org` repo. Use the one that best suits the issue, as well as the way you prefer to work:

- Use the **Edit this page** link located the bottom of every documentation page on [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org).

  Using this technique enables you to submit your PR using a UI. This approach may be preferable for people who don't want to interact with GitHub using git in a command line interface.

  Note that this technique allows you to make a change to an existing page of documentation only. To add a new page, you must fork the repo.

  To learn more, see [Submit a PR using the Edit this page link](#submit-a-PR-using-the-Edit-this-page-link).

- Fork the `xmtp-dot-org` repo, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit your PR.

  When you submit your PR, please reference the GitHub Issue the PR addresses.

  To learn more about forking a repo, see [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) in GitHub's documentation.

  When you use this technique to submit your PR, you might find it useful to [set up a local environment](#set-up-a-local-environment).

## Set up a local environment (optional)

If you are contributing to [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) documentation by forking the `xmtp-dot-org` repo, you might be interested in setting up a local environment so you can build the site and see your changes.

[xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above installed. You can check your version by running `node -v`.

Docusaurus recommends checking all checkboxes related to dependencies when you install Node.

Node is required because you need npm, a tool installed along with Node, to install and run Docusaurus.

If you need to manage multiple Node versions installed on a single machine, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

To learn more, see [Installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) in Docusaurus' documentation.

### Install Docusaurus

To install Docusaurus:

1. At the command line, navigate to the root folder of your fork of the `xmtp-dot-org` repo.
2. Run `npm install`.

### Run a local development server

Run a local development server to serve up the website and reflect your changes as you edit files.

To start and run the server, run `npm run start`.

The command opens the website at http://localhost:3000/ in your default browser.

As you make and save changes to markdown files, the website automatically updates to reflect your changes.

### Build the site

When you run the build command, Docusaurus generates static HTML website pages based on markdown file content and puts the HTML into the `build` directory. This generated static HTML is what is served up on [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org).

To build the website HTML, run `npm run build`.

To view the build, run `npm run serve`.

The command opens the static website at http://localhost:3000/ in your default browser.

Any changes you save to markdown files aren't reflected in this build because this content is being served directly from the static HTML in the `build` directory.
