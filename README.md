### Contribute to XMTP documentation

You can contribute by creating and updating XMTP documentation.

Except for [quick fixes](#make-a-quick-fix), before you start contributing to XMTP documentation, please open a documentation issue first by [reporting a bug](#report-a-bug) or [requesting a feature](#request-a-feature).

Opening a documentation issue first allows the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team the opportunity to share relevant context for your proposed contribution.

To contribute to XMTP documentation, you must [submit a pull request](#submit-a-pull-request-to-the-xmtp-dot-org-repo) (PR) to the `xmtp-dot-org` repo.

A PR is a request to the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team to add (or pull) your content updates into the project and publish them to the documentation on the site. After you submit a pull request, your proposed changes are publicly visible, meaning that anyone with a GitHub account can see them on GitHub.

<!--create a "good first issue" label, assign it to relevant issues, and then uncomment this doc: To see a list of issues that might be good starting points for community documentation contributions, see [xmtp-dot-org Issues](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-dot-org/issues).-->

## Submit a pull request to the `xmtp-dot-org` repo

Here are two common methods for submitting a PR to the `xmtp-dot-org` repo. Use the one that best suits the issue and the way you like to work:

- Use the **Edit this page** link at the bottom of every documentation page on [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org).

  This method provides a guided flow for editing content and submitting a PR using the GitHub UI in a web browser. Note that this method only allows you to submit a PR to an **existing** documentation page.

  To learn more, see [Use the Edit this page link to submit a PR](#use-the-edit-this-page-link-to-submit-a-pr).

- Manually fork the `xmtp-dot-org` repo, make your changes, and submit your PR.

  To learn more about forking a repo, see [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) in GitHub's documentation.

  When you use this technique to submit your PR, you might find it useful to [set up a local environment](#set-up-a-local-environment).

When you submit a PR, include a link to the documentation issue your PR addresses.  

After you've submitted your PR, the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team will review your PR and either:

- Accept your proposal and publish your change
- Accept your proposal but ask for some changes before publishing
- Not accept your proposal and explain why
<!--consider providing an SLA for acknowledgement of receipt time.-->

The [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team includes technical writers, product managers, developers, designers, and other XMTP subject matter experts. The team reviews documentation PRs based on their accuracy in describing supported functionality, developer and user goals and needs, and XMTP content style guidelines.
<!--need to make this style guide public for this reason. For now, it may should be fine to just have the team fix style in PRs.-->

## Use the **Edit this page** link to submit a PR

1. Click the **Edit this page** link at the bottom of the page you want to fix. The link takes you to the page‚Äôs markdown file on GitHub.

2. The GitHub UI might tell you that you need to fork the repository to propose changes. Forking the repo means that you‚Äôre making an editable copy of the `xmtp-dot-org` repo. Click **Fork this repository** to continue.

3. Edit the markdown file to make your change.

4. Once you‚Äôre happy with your change, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Propose changes** section. Add a short description explaining the reason for your change, including a link to the GitHub Issue your PR addresses. GitHub adds this information to the file‚Äôs changelog, which can help future users understand the purpose of your update. Click **Propose changes**.

5. A confirmation page appears. Use it to review your proposed changes. Click **Create pull request**. You have one more chance to review your change on the next page before you submit it to the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team for review.

6. Now, to finally create your PR! You‚Äôll see the change description you entered earlier. You can add some additional information if you want to. Once you‚Äôre happy with your PR, select **Create pull request**.

7. When you create a PR, the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) team receives a notification to review it.

## Set up a local environment

If you are contributing to [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) documentation by forking the `xmtp-dot-org` repo, you might be interested in setting up a local environment so you can build the site and see your changes.

[xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or later installed. You can check your version by running `node -v`.

Docusaurus recommends selecting all checkboxes related to dependencies when you install Node.

Node is required because you need npm, a tool installed along with Node, to install and run Docusaurus.

To learn more, see [Installation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) in the Docusaurus documentation.

### Install Docusaurus

To install Docusaurus:

1. At the command line, navigate to the root folder of your fork of the `xmtp-dot-org` repo.

2. Run `npm install`.

### Run a local development server

You can run a local development server to view the website and check your changes as you edit files.

To start and run the server, run `npm run start`.

The command opens the website at `http://localhost:3000/` in your default browser.

As you make and save changes to markdown files, the website automatically updates to reflect your changes.

### Build the site

When you run the build command, Docusaurus generates a static website build and puts it into the `build` folder.

1. To generate a static website build, run `npm run build`.

2. To view the static website build, run `npm run serve`.

   The command opens the website at http://localhost:3000/ in your default browser.

Note that any changes you save to markdown files aren't reflected in this static build because the website is served from the `build` directory, not from the markdown files.
