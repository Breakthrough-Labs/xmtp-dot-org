# XMTP Website Starter Kit

This web starter is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

This repo will serve as the base for new websites to be built at `xmtp.com` (for XMTP Labs) and `xmtp.org` (for XMTP). Any changes that would need to happen on both sites should be made here, and upstream changes pulled in each individual repo.

## Installation

``` txt
npm install
```

## Local Development

``` txt
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

``` txt
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

See the [official project documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.0.0-beta.15/deployment) on Deployment.
