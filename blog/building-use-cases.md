# Building use-cases with XMTP

![](./media/usecases.png)

Building in web3 means building in a decentralized digital dimension where users have ownership and portability of their assets. In the context of communications we spend most of our time in chat apps whcih we do not control nor we can trust. 

Building on top of XMTP we can be sure we own our communications and that our communications are, in fact, ours. With added interoperability in the space we can laverage this benefits and have the same expeiernece across multiple apps. This means eventually the bank, our friends and our subscriptions will be talking to us in the same channel.

This channel, or what we called it, the universal inbox is going to allow for different expierences and different use cases across the digital space. From finance to customer support and AI, as long as we implement ecosystem wide standards every app will serve as a gateway for multiple use cases removing friction and the need for specialized apps for most interactions.

In XMTP we are thinking about how to make sense of this use cases and we have compiled a list to inspire developers to join us in our journey. 

Discover the potential of buildig in web3 with XMTP. If you need help with ideas, this is the right place for you.
