## **Left Nav Centralization üìò**

We‚Äôve centralized all documentation in a single Left Nav. It's like the chapters of a book, ensuring the lowest friction experience for learning software. A unique left nav documentation is the excellent companion tool that needs just one tab in your browser. This single tab approach ensures that you have a consistent navigation experience without the clutter.

## **Language Simplification üó£**

We‚Äôve streamlined our language to keep it simple and relatable. For instance, Preview, Dev Preview, and General Availability are now `Alpha`, `Beta` & `Production` ‚úÖ. Also, many of our independent docs have been merged into traditional Developer `FAQs`

## **Hackathons Hub üèÅ**

Discover a hub dedicated to hackathons that we can update ad-hoc, providing a centralized space for showcasing possibilities and aligning with our priorities.
