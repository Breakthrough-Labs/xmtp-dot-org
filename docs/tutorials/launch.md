## Get pre-launch feedback

Preparing to launch? Be sure to:

- Follow the development and UX best practices provided in the documentation of the XMTP features you included in your app
- Run through these [recommended test cases](test-your-app)
- Revisit these [performance guidelines](performance)
- Enable your app to track privacy-preserving metrics to help you understand app usage. For example:
  - \# of active wallets: Wallets sending at least one message
  - \# of active conversations: Conversations with at least one message
  - \# of returning conversations: Conversations with at least one message per participant

After your team has tested your app and reviewed the app best practices, message `prxshant.eth` using [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat/) to get pre-launch feedback from XMTP Labs. Provide a link to a preview app, TestFlight, or demo video.

## Launch your app

Way to go! ðŸŽ‰ Here are some resources and ideas for promoting your app launch:

- Register for the Polygon [dApp Store Kit](https://docs.dappstorekit.io/docs/how%20to%20use%20the%20dapp%20store%20kit/dapp-registry-management/), which enables developers to launch their own dApp stores and list any dApp, including their own. To learn more, see the [dApp Store Kit Wiki](https://polygontechnology.notion.site/dApp-Store-Kit-Wiki-a3a9e7518b80400589aee8164550838e).
