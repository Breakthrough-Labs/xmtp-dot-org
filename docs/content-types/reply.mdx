# Reply Content Type

A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

### Install the package

Use the following commands to install the package:

```bash
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reply
```

### Import and register

```tsx
import { ContentTypeReply, ReplyCodec } from "@xmtp/content-type-reply";
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: "dev" });
// Register the codecs, AttachmentCodec is for handling local attachments under 1MB
xmtp.registerCodec(new ReplyCodec());
```

### Create a Reply

In XMTP, replies are represented as objects with two keys:

- `reference`: The message ID for the message that is being replied to

- `content`: A string representation of the reply

```tsx
const reply: Reply = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  content: "I concur",
};
```

### Sending a Reply

Once you've created a reply, you can send it:

```tsx
await conversation.send(reply, {
  contentType: ContentTypeReply,
});
```

### Receiving a Reply

Here's how you can receive a reply:

```tsx
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReply)) {
  // We've got a reply.
  const reply: Reply = message.content;
}
```

### Displaying the Reply

Replies should generally be displayed alongside the original message to provide context. However, the way you choose to display replies is completely up to you.
