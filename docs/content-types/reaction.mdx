# Reaction Content Type

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Content_type_status-Standards--track-yellow) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reference_implementation_status-Beta-yellow)

A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the messaging app.

:::

### Install the package

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```bash
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

### Import and register

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```tsx
import {
  ContentTypeReaction,
  ReactionCodec,
} from "@xmtp/content-type-reaction";
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: "dev" });
// Register the codecs, AttachmentCodec is for handling local attachments under 1MB
xmtp.registerCodec(new ReactionCodec());
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

### Create a reaction

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

- `reference`: The message ID for the message that is being reacted to

- `action`: The action of the reaction (added or removed)

- `content`: A string representation of a reaction (e.g. smile) to be interpreted by clients

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```tsx
const reaction = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  action: "added",
  content: "smile",
};
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

### Send a reaction

Now that you have a reaction, you can send it:

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```tsx
await conversation.send(reaction, {
  contentType: ContentTypeReaction,
});
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

### Receive a reaction

Now that you can send a reaction, you need a way to receive a reaction. For example:

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```tsx
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReaction)) {
  // We've got a reaction.
  const reaction: Reaction = message.content;
}
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

### Display the reaction

Generally, reactions should be interpreted as emoji. So, "smile" would translate to ðŸ˜„ in UI clients. That being said, how you ultimately choose to render a reaction in your app is up to you.
