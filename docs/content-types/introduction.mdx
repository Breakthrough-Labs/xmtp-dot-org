# Content Types with XMTP

When you build an app with XMTP, all messages are encoded with a content type to ensure that an XMTP message API client knows how to encode and decode messages, ensuring interoperability and consistent display of messages across apps.

In addition, message payloads are transported as a set of bytes. This means that payloads can carry any content type that a client supports, such as plain text, JSON, or even non-text binary or media content.

At a high level, there are two categories of content types with XMTP:

- Standard
- Custom

## Standard content types

A standard content type is one that has undergone the XMTP Request for Comment (XRC) process and has been adopted as an XMTP Improvement Proposal (XIP).

To learn more about the XRC and XIP processes that enable a framework for community members to propose standards and achieve consensus about their adoption, see [XMTP Improvement Proposals (XIPs)](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs#readme).

Once adopted, a standard content type is bundled in XMTP client SDKs. A developer can then import the standard content type from an SDK for use in their app.

- ### [Text Content Type](/docs/content-types/plain-text)

An app built with XMTP uses the `TextCodec` (plain text) standard content type by default. This means that if your app is sending plain text messages only, you donâ€™t need to perform any additional steps related to content types.

- ### [Composite Content Type](/docs/content-types/composite)

If you want your app to be able to send multiple content types; such as any combination of plain text, images, audio, and video; in a single message, you must set up your app to use the `CompositeCodec` standard content type.

## Custom Content Types

Any developer building with XMTP can create a custom content type and immediately start using it in their app. Unlike a standard content type, use of a custom content type doesn't require prerequisite formal adoption through the XRC and XIP processes.

- ### [Attachment Content Type](/docs/content-types/attachment)

Attachments smaller than 1MB can be sent using the `AttachmentCodec`. The codec will automatically encrypt the attachment and upload it to the XMTP network.

- ### [Remote Attachment Content Type](/docs/content-types/remote-attachment)

Remote attachments of any size can be sent using the `RemoteAttachmentCodec` and a storage provider.

- ### [Read Receipt Content Type](/docs/content-types/read-receipt)

A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

- ### [Reaction Content Type](/docs/content-types/reaction)

A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the messaging app.

- ### [Reply Content Type](/docs/content-types/reply)

A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

#### [Create Custom Content Type](/docs/content-types/custom)

For example, if you need a content type that isn't covered, you can create a custom content type and begin using it immediately in your app.

:::info
Your custom content type WILL NOT automatically be supported by other apps and will display fallback text in them instead.
:::

If another app wants to display your custom content type, they must implement your custom content type in their code exactly as it's defined in your code.

Fallback plain text is "alt text"-like description text that you can associate with a custom content type if you are concerned that a receiving app might not be able to handle the content. If the receiving app is unable to handle the custom content, it displays the fallback plain text instead.
