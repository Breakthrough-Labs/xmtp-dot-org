# Read Receipt Content Type

A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

### Install the package

Use the following commands to install the package:

```bash
npm i @xmtp/content-type-read-receipt
```

### Import libraries

```tsx
import {
  ContentTypeReadReceipt,
  ReadReceiptCodec,
} from "@xmtp/content-type-read-receipt";
```

### Register codec

```tsx
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: "dev" });
// Register the codecs, AttachmentCodec is for handling local attachments under 1MB
xmtp.registerCodec(new ReadReceiptCodec());
```

### Create a Read Receipt

In XMTP, replies are represented as objects with two keys:

- `reference`: The message ID for the message that is being replied to

- `content`: A string representation of the reply

```tsx
const reply: Read Receipt = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  content: "I concur",
};
```

### Sending a Read Receipt

Once you've created a reply, you can send it:

```tsx
await conversation.send(readReceipt, {
  contentType: ContentTypeReadReceipt,
});
```

Note: Use contentFallback to allow clients that don't support these content types to still display some useful context. For clients that do support these types, they can use the content fallback as alt text for accessibility purposes.

### Receiving a Read Receipt

Here's how you can receive a reply:

```tsx
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeRead Receipt)) {
  // We've got a reply.
  const reply: Read Receipt = message.content;
}
```

### Displaying the Read Receipt

Replies should generally be displayed alongside the original message to provide context. However, the way you choose to display replies is completely up to you.
