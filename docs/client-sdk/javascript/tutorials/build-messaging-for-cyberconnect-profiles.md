# Build messaging for CyberConnect profiles

This tutorial describes how to build with XMTP to provide messaging for CyberConnect decentralized social media profiles (ccProfiles).

Specifically, the tutorial walks through how to integrate the [XMTP Inbox web app](https://github.com/xmtp-labs/xmtp-inbox-web) with CyberConnectâ€™s ccProfile and API to provide:

- Address resolution through ccProfile handles, such as `ryan.cyber`

- Conversation filters based on connection status, such as Following, Follower, and Connected

- A Follow/Unfollow control for user conversations with ccProfile owners
