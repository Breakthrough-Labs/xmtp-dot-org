# Web3 social

[Lens Protocol ðŸŒ¿](https://docs.lens.xyz/) and [CyberConnect](https://cyberconnect.hashnode.dev/) apps use XMTP to provide secure, private messaging to their users. Using web3 social media apps, also known as decentralized social, users are able to discover new friends and communicate with them.
