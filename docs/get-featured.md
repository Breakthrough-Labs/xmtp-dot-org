This guide will provide essential steps and recommendations to ensure that your XMTP-based app is launched successfully, optimizes performance, and is thoroughly tested.

## **A. Quality Checklist**

Before launching, ensure your app meets the following criteria:

### **Performance**

- [ ] Implement a [Local-first cache](/docs/build/local-first).
- [ ] Cache conversation list **`conversations.list()`** to boost performance by 90%.
- [ ] Serialize securely stored **`DecodedMessage`** histories to reduce redundant downloads and decryptions.
- [ ] Implement message [pagination](/docs/build/messages#list-messages-in-a-conversation-with-pagination).
- [ ] [Compress message content](/docs/build/messages#compress-message-content) with a suitable compression algorithm.
- [ ] (Bonus) Implement [optimistic sending](/docs/tutorials/other/optimistic-sending).

### **Bugs and Reliability**

- [ ] No duplicate conversations should be created or displayed. If duplicates exist, only the latest conversation should be visible.
- [ ] The app should be stable and not crash frequently.
- [ ] No visible critical bugs.

### **SDK and App Versions**

- [ ] Make sure to use the [latest](/docs/changelog) XMTP client SDK.
- [ ] Always set an **`appVersion`** [value](/docs/build/authentication#configure-the-client).
- [ ] Follow our [testing tutorial](/docs/tutorials/debug-and-test)

### Content Types

- [ ] Include image [remote attachments](/docs/content-types/remote-attachment).
- [ ] Include [message replies](/docs/content-types/reply)
- [ ] Include [message reactions](/docs/content-types/reaction)
- [ ] Include [read receipts](/docs/content-types/read-receipt)
- [ ] (Bonus) Implement a [custom content type](/docs/content-types/custom-advanced)

### **Resolution**

- [ ] Offer forward and reverse [identity resolution](/docs/tutorials/identity-resolution) support for ENS.
- [ ] (Bonus) Support for UNS, cb.id, .lens, Cyberconnect.

### **Metrics**

Enable your app to keep track of:

- [ ] Number of active wallets: At least one message sent.
- [ ] Number of active conversations: At least one message.
- [ ] Number of returning conversations: A minimum of one message from each participant.

## B. Launch your app

Way to go! ðŸŽ‰ Here are some resources and ideas for promoting your app launch:
