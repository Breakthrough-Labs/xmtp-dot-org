## Release annoucements

### Nov 19, 2022

Mobile SDKs for XMTP client apps are now available in Developer Preview.

XMTP now supports a Swift SDK, Flutter SDK, and a React Native example app. This enables developers to bring end-to-end encrypted, web3 chat experiences to mobile. Now you can build interoperable inboxes that transcend devices and operating systems, allowing users to take their messages wherever they go.

To learn more, refer to the GitHub repos: [xmtp-ios](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-ios), [xmtp-flutter](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-flutter), [example-chat-react-native](https://github.com/xmtp/example-chat-react-native).

**Note**: Developer Preview software is not ready for use in production apps.
