## Decentralization roadmap

ðŸŽ‰Â Anyone can now try running the [experimental `xmtpd` node software](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd) and be a part of the journey to decentralizing XMTP! In the future, `xmtpd` might replace the node software currently running the XMTP network. 

### Near term (~3 months)

- Open source nodes
- Third-party nodes in testnet
- Smart contract inbox

### Long term (~6 months)

- Limited public testnet: Third-party operators can run `xmtpd` nodes that participate in the XMTP network
- v1 economic model, including universal consent
